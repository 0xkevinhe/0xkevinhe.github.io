            <h1 id="a-brief-report-on-bitcoins-next-upgrade-for-all">A Brief Report
on Bitcoin's Next Upgrade for All</h1>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Discussions about Bitcoin's next upgrade have been ongoing, but as of
December 2024, the community has yet to reach a consensus on whether to
upgrade, what problems the upgrade should address, or what
functionalities it should introduce. The debate remains polarized,
resembling a political stalemate.</p>
<p>In this deadlock, several interesting phenomena have emerged: 1. A
portion of the community actively pushes for upgrades. Driven by
information asymmetry or commercial interests, some members frequently
advocate for specific opcodes, and certain projects even depend on
opcodes that "might" appear in the future. 2. A significant number of
pragmatic ecosystem developers have made considerable cryptographic and
engineering efforts to expand Bitcoin's potential, all without assuming
protocol upgrades. 3. Voices advocating for slow upgrades or outright
opposing upgrades are also substantial.</p>
<p>These phenomena highlight that the topic of upgrades is highly
popular within the Bitcoin community. However, they also reveal that
many community members lack a comprehensive understanding of the
complete process of a Bitcoin upgrade. Additionally, there is limited
awareness of how innovative cryptographic tools can enhance Bitcoin's
potential.The core purpose of this article is to break through this
information asymmetry, align everyone’s understanding, and facilitate
deeper discussions on the topic.</p>
<p>This article aims to define Bitcoin upgrades, trace historical
developments to identify certain patterns, analyze current upgrade
proposals, and provide readers with key takeaways. By presenting this
information, the goal is to equip readers with a solid foundation in
understanding the concept, history, and progress of Bitcoin upgrades,
thus enabling more informed discussions and contributing to the eventual
formation of community consensus.</p>
<p>The article strives to present facts objectively. However, as the
author is a developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem and envisions greater
possibilities for Bitcoin, certain viewpoints will be explicitly
expressed on specific topics. Readers are encouraged to discern these
perspectives critically.</p>
<h1 id="upgrade-overview-what-and-why"><strong>Upgrade Overview: What
and Why</strong></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-bitcoin-upgrade"><strong>What is a Bitcoin
Upgrade?</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a>
defines a protocol that operates a blockchain network composed of
thousands of nodes following the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>These implementations, or clients, come in various versions, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin Core</a> being the
most widely used client, as shown by data from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bitnodes.io/nodes/">bitnodes</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, the Bitcoin Core maintainers (referred to as
<strong>Bitcoin-Core-Devs</strong> ) have significant influence over
Bitcoin’s development.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kevinhe.io/bitcoin-next-upgrade/what-why-1.png" alt="img">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bitcoin node software consists of multiple modules, and upgrades are
defined through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">Bitcoin
Improvement Proposals (BIPs)</a>. When discussing Bitcoin upgrades, it
usually refers to <strong>consensus protocol
upgrades</strong>—modifications requiring agreement among the majority
of the network’s nodes to avoid forks.</p>
<p>As illustrated below, Bitcoin’s consensus protocol modules and
related BIP proposals are of particular interest in upgrade
discussions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kevinhe.io/bitcoin-next-upgrade/what-why-2.png" alt="img">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulse/monthly">statistics</a>
from the Bitcoin GitHub repository , development activity is vibrant.
However, most changes are unrelated to the consensus protocol and thus
do not attract widespread attention.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-consensus-upgrades"><strong>Types of Consensus
Upgrades</strong></h2>
<p>Per <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0123.mediawiki">BIP-123</a>,
consensus protocol upgrades are classified into <strong>Soft
Forks</strong> and <strong>Hard Forks</strong>:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 26%">
<col style="width: 35%">
<col style="width: 38%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Soft Fork</th>
<th>Hard Fork</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Compatibility</td>
<td>Compatible with old nodes</td>
<td>Incompatible with old nodes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Network-wide Update</td>
<td>Not always required</td>
<td>Required</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Examples</td>
<td>SegWit/Taproot</td>
<td>Bitcoin XT/Bitcoin Cash</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another intuitive way to interpret these is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Fork</strong>: Adds or strengthens rules (e.g.,
introducing new functionalities like Taproot addresses).</li>
<li><strong>Hard Fork</strong>: Removes or loosens rules (e.g., removing
block reward limitations).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="soft-fork-process-bip-workflows"><strong>Soft Fork Process (BIP
Workflows)</strong></h2>
<p>The previous two successful consensus upgrades (SegWit and Taproot)
both utilized soft forks, avoiding significant community splits. Thus,
this article focuses on soft forks, which enable upgrades while
maintaining compatibility with older software.</p>
<p>The typical workflow of a BIP proposal leading to a soft fork is
illustrated below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Source:
https://river.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip/</p>
<p>Soft forks often combine multiple BIPs into a single proposal. For
example, <strong>Taproot</strong> incorporated three BIPs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Schnorr Signature: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki">BIP-340</a></li>
<li>Taproot: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki">BIP-341</a></li>
<li>Tapscript: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki">BIP-342</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Timeline of the Taproot Upgrade</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://kevinhe.io/bitcoin-next-upgrade/Taproot-timeline.jpg" alt="img"> Source: Kraken Intelligence, GitHub, CoinDesk,
https://www.argoblockchain.com/articles/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-explained</p>
<p><strong>Key milestones in Taproot soft fork</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Corresponding BIPs proposed and reviewed.</li>
<li>Bitcoin-Core-Devs submit a GitHub pull request.</li>
<li>Code is reviewed, merged, and activation methods determined.</li>
<li>The new Bitcoin-core client version was released.</li>
<li>Miners signal via on-chain voting to approve the bip's activation
parameters.</li>
<li>Block height reached, completing the upgrade.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that this process is a retrospective summary
based on historical observations, and in reality, there is no formalized
consensus on this milestone.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev">Bitcoin Development
Mailing List</a> has played a pivotal role in consolidating consensus
among various parties.</p>
<h2 id="why-upgrade"><strong>Why Upgrade?</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, there are currently
three main perspectives within the community regarding upgrades:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Proactive Advocates: This group has proposed numerous upgrade ideas,
which will be analyzed in the sections below.</li>
<li>Pragmatic Builders: They focus on solutions within the existing
protocol, such as implementing Fraud Proofs (e.g., BitVM and its
extensions), functional encryption (covenants and ZK-proofs via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.allocin.it/uploads/placeholder-bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin
PIPEs</a> ) and hash collisions (covenants via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1802">ColliderScript</a>), etc.</li>
<li>Conservatives: This group includes the TeamSlowAndSteady, which
advocates for extremely slow and cautious upgrades (e.g., a 10-year
cycle), and the Ossifiers, who oppose upgrades unless there is an
existential threat like quantum attacks (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/is-ossification-good-or-bad-for-bitcoin/">Is
Ossification Good or Bad for Bitcoin</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The author conducted an analysis of the pros and cons of upgrading
versus not upgrading.</p>

<p>As a pragmatic developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the author
believes that fully exploring Bitcoin's potential through cryptographic
or engineering innovations within the existing protocol framework is
indispensable. At the same time, from the perspectives of
"sustainability" and "adaptability," it is advisable to implement
continuous upgrades as needed, provided the impact and security risks
are thoroughly evaluated.</p>
<h1 id="in-depth-analysis-of-upgrades"><strong>In-Depth Analysis of
Upgrades</strong></h1>
<h2 id="stakeholders-in-bitcoin-upgrades"><strong>Stakeholders in
Bitcoin Upgrades</strong></h2>
<p>In Bitcoin’s history, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff">Hong
Kong Consensus</a> (signed during the Bitcoin Roundtable in February
2016) identified three primary stakeholder groups:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Bitcoin-Core-Devs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mining Pools</strong></li>
<li><strong>Users and Ecosystem Developers</strong> (primarily
exchanges, chip manufacturers, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>As Bitcoin adoption has grown rapidly, the stakeholder landscape has
evolved from this simple triad into a more fragmented and competitive
environment. This is illustrated in the informative report from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin-cap/bcap">Analyzing Bitcoin Consensus:
Risks in Protocol Upgrades</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kevinhe.io/bitcoin-next-upgrade/stakeholders.png" alt="img">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Among these stakeholders, several key roles are worth
highlighting:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Economic Nodes</strong>: These include major centralized
exchanges (CEX), payment processors, and custodial service providers.
Their stance on soft forks heavily influences what is considered
"legitimate" Bitcoin and impacts adoption rates.</li>
<li><strong>Investors</strong>: With Bitcoin ETFs, institutional
reserves, and even sovereign reserves becoming mainstream, this group
has grown increasingly complex.</li>
<li><strong>Users & Ecosystem Developers</strong>: Following the
Taproot upgrade, Bitcoin's ecosystem has flourished, giving rise to
protocols like Ordinals and numerous native applications and scaling
solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Observations on Stakeholders</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Different roles at different stages</strong>: For instance,
Ecosystem Developers actively push proposals, Protocol Developers
exercise their authority over BIP reviews, while mining pools and
economic nodes wield significant influence during activation.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial interests drive some proposals</strong>:
Ecosystem Developers often propose and support upgrades aligned with
their business interests. For example, proponents of Validity Rollup are
inclined to support <code>OP_CAT</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="history-and-summary-of-bitcoin-upgrades"><strong>History and
Summary of Bitcoin Upgrades</strong></h2>
<p>Public data reveals multiple <strong>soft fork upgrades</strong>
since Bitcoin’s inception.</p>

</ul>
<p>From the chart, 2 conclusions can be drawn:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bitcoin’s protocol has become increasingly rigid, with the frequency
of soft forks declining over time.</li>
<li>Reaching consensus on upgrades now takes significantly longer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="focus-areas-of-soft-forks"><strong>Focus Areas of Soft

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-upgrade-proposal"><strong>What Makes a Good
Upgrade Proposal?</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the analysis above, a good upgrade proposal should:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Uphold Bitcoin’s Core Role as a Payment System</strong>: Any
upgrade must align with Bitcoin’s unique positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Strike a Balance Between Potential Benefits and
Risks</strong>: It should be broadly acceptable and not polarizing.</li>
<li><strong>Have an Appropriate Scope</strong>: Proposals should neither
be too trivial nor overly complex to implement.</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: Upgrades should address pressing needs,
such as SegWit addressing the scalability demand during its time.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="future-outlook"><strong>Future Outlook</strong></h1>
<h2 id="proposal-classification"><strong>Proposal
Classification</strong></h2>
<p>The author has compiled most of the active proposals, assigned focus
area tags to them, and categorized them into four quadrants to provide
readers with a visual understanding. Points to note regarding the
classification: 1. The four focus areas are not entirely isolated from
one another. For instance, a BIP that enhances programmability might
also contribute to scalability to some extent. 2. A proposal may address
multiple focus areas. For example, while OP_CAT primarily enhances
programmability, its broader support comes from its role in enabling
validity rollups. 3. Determining which focus areas a proposal addresses
requires a degree of "consensus" (inherently political). It's important
to note that there is no single definition, as different stakeholders
may interpret the same proposal from varying perspectives. 4. The second
diagram is not a coordinate system; it categorizes proposals based on
their tags. The attributes of the circles (such as size, position, or
color) do not carry any specific meaning.</p>

<h2 id="community-sentiment"><strong>Community Sentiment</strong></h2>
<p>From the chart above, the community appears to have reached some
consensus on the problems upgrades should address, particularly in two
areas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Programmability</strong>: Enhancing UTXO programmability for
use cases like covenants, vaults, transaction introspection, conditional
payments, and script enhancements.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Improving Layer 2 scaling, with
proposals divided into on-chain and off-chain verification
solutions.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="the-puzzle-of-consensus"><strong>The Puzzle of
Consensus</strong></h1>
<p>The author believes that the Bitcoin community has fallen into a
consensus maze regarding the next upgrade due to the following
reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ossification</strong>: With a fully diluted value (FDV)
nearing <strong>$2 trillion</strong>, stakeholders lean towards
stability, as no one wants to bear responsibility for potential
mishaps.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmented Stakeholders</strong>: Diverse interests and
varying levels of influence at different stages make consensus elusive;
even governments have emerged as stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Imperfect Governance Mechanism</strong>: As the earliest
blockchain, Bitcoin lacks a highly refined governance mechanism; the
community has also been unable to reach a consensus on the methods for
activating soft forks.</li>
<li><strong>The role of Protocol Developers is inherently
dynamic</strong>: While they may indeed reject certain proposals, it
cannot be simply characterized as conservative or progressive.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Urgency</strong>: With maturing blockchain
infrastructure, there’s no overwhelming demand for immediate Bitcoin
upgrades.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion-takeaways"><strong>Conclusion &
Takeaways</strong></h1>
<p>This article introduced the fundamental concepts of Bitcoin upgrades,
provided an in-depth analysis of historical upgrades, and reviewed
active proposals for the next upgrade. The causes of the current
"consensus puzzle" were also identified.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pragmatic development while cautiously advancing upgrades; soft
forks are preferable.</li>
<li>Stakeholders are highly fragmented, leading to a conservative stance
from the community.</li>
<li>Discussions about upgrades must adhere to Bitcoin’s core value
proposition.</li>
<li>Scalability is just one of many focus areas for upgrades.</li>
<li>Timing is critical—strong proposals will gain consensus more
quickly.</li>
<li>The community must explore improved governance mechanisms.</li>
</ol>
